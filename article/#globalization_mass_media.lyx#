Mass Media and the Domestic Politics of Globalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the relationship between economic globalization and the modern
 welfare state has been one of the most studied issues in political economy
 over the past three decades (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "316"
key "Gourevitch:1978bn,Garrett:1995tj,Rodrik:1998te,Burgoon:2001dp,Adsera:2002vt,Oatley:2011hv"

\end_inset

), recent research on public opinion and political behavior in open economies
 raises serious questions about the assumptions of this tradition (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "155"
key "Hellwig:2007wt"

\end_inset

).
 A fundamental assumption in globalization-welfare research, which dates
 back to Karl Polanyi's 
\emph on
The Great Transformation,
\emph default
 is that policymakers who wish to liberalize economic markets are held accountab
le by those groups who would suffer the adjustment costs (Polanyi [1944]
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

after "79, 385"
key "Polanyi:2001vc"

\end_inset

).
 Scholars have shown that to sustain political coalitions in favor of opening
 national economies, national policymakers have to compensate protectionist
 domestic groups with side payments in the form of social welfare programs
 (

key "Katzenstein:1985ub,Rodrik:1998te,Adsera:2002vt"

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, research in comparative political behavior shows that as domestic
 economies become increasingly integrated, citizens perceive that governments
 have less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

room to maneuver
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and accordingly shift their blame away from domestic policymakers to the
 unaccountable pressures of the global economy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Alcaniz:2010gb,Hellwig:2012vk"

\end_inset

).
 Citizens in countries highly exposed to the global economy are less likely
 to punish incumbents for a poorly performing economy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hellwig:2007gn"

\end_inset

) and more likely to base their vote on non-economic issues (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hellwig:2008ia"

\end_inset

).
 If domestic groups do not punish politicians for economic losses made possibile
 by the political decisions to maintain open national economies, then an
 essential causal link in current accounts of the globalization-welfare
 nexus may not hold under certain conditions.
 Furthermore, this current of research has yet to take seriously that economic
 globalization does not 
\emph on
inherently
\emph default
 constrain policymakers'

 but rather has been socially constructed as such by elites and typically
 through the mass media (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hay:2011dh,Hay:2005dh,Hay:2002iy"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the same time, previous research has shown that mass media have direct
 effects on perceptions relevant to how citizens are likely to understand
 the politics of globalization.
 Specifically, mass media have direct effects on perceptions of responsibility
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Iyengar:1987uo"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Iyengar:1991uf"

\end_inset

), the politicization of economic hardship (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Mutz:1992ww"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Mutz:1994kp"

\end_inset

), and civic engagement more broadly (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Putnam:1995vj"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Norris:2000uf"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hooghe:2002bi"

\end_inset

).
 Certainly, these effects are still debated and, in fact, the conventional
 wisdom in the political economy of media associates robust mass media systems
 with government responsiveness and accountability (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "JamesMSnyder:2012th,Besley:2002tg,Adsera:2003cc"

\end_inset

).
 Yet, in the specific context of the distributive domestic politics of globaliza
tion, the preponderance of previous research strongly converges on a set
 of counter-intuitive arguments: By amplifying the dominant construction
 of globalization as an external imperative constraining policymakers and
 in this way shifting citizen blame attributions away from governments and
 toward international forces, the mass media should reduce the ability of
 domestic groups to hold national policymakers accountable for the effects
 of economic openness.
 In turn, as the global economy and mass media penetrate states, national
 policymakers should face less pressure to compensate protectionist domestic
 groups for economic hardships linked to the global economy.
 As states become increasingly penetrated by both the global economy and
 mass media, at the state-level we should observe a weakened relationship
 between economic openness and welfare spending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These expectations are tested with survey data and state-level economic
 data ideally suited to assess the implications of these arguments at both
 levels of analysis.
 A Legidoscope survey from France in 1992-1993 provides a uniquely valuable
 opportunity to test the argument that mass media has independent effects
 on individuals' perceptions, blame attributions, and behavior around issues
 of economic openness.
 The findings show that mass media exposure is positively associated with
 individuals' perceptions of economic openness as a problem and then, controllin
g for whether economic openness is perceived as a problem, the attribution
 of blame to international forces.
 For comparability with respect to previous research on the globalization-welfar
e nexus, the state-level implications of the theory are tested on pooled
 cross-sectional, time-series data from most countries in the world between
 1960 and 2010.
 Using penetration rates of information-communication technology (ICT) as
 a proxy for the prevalence of mass media within states---in particular,
 the number of newspapers, televisions, and radios per person---several
 analyses across multiple model specifications suggest that the spread of
 ICT and the mass media they carry is associated with a weakening of the
 positive relationship between economic openness and social welfare spending.
 The dampening effect of mass media holds after controlling for several
 rival explanations and when included in the replication of previous, influentia
l studies.
 Consistent with the survey analysis, the state-level associations are interpret
ed as evidence for the argument that policymakers are more likely to neglect
 domestic groups harmed by political decisions to liberalize markets the
 more prevalent is mass media within their states.
 Specifically, this is because mass media tends to shift the perceptual
 and behavioral response of protectionist individuals away from blaming
 and acting against the government on the politics of openness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings alter the prevailing wisdom in at least two ways.
 First, they provide new evidence for the claim that economic openness makes
 citizens less likely to blame, and less likely to punish, incumbent governments
 for poor economic performance, but they also reveal that mass media exposure
 may be an alternative and independent causal path to the same effect, controlli
ng for perceptions of economic openness.
 Second, this is one of the first systematic investigations of mass media
 as a political 
\emph on
institution
\emph default
 that conditions the domestic politics of the global economy.
 As such, it directly responds to calls for more truly political accounts
 of the domestic effects of globalization (

) and for a more rigorous examination of the micro-foundations of work in
 this tradition (

\begin_layout Standard
The article proceeds as follows.
 In the first section, previous literature is reviewed to reveal a gap between
 comparative and international political economists on the one hand and
 scholars of public opinion and political behavior on the other, and to
 suggest how mass media research speaks directly to this gap.
 A second section develops specific hypotheses regarding how mass media
 is likely to affect individual perceptions, blame attributions, and electoral
 accountability around the politics of economic openness.
 A third section discusses the data and modeling strategy, the penultimate
 section discusses the core findings, and a final section concludes.

Mass Media Between Globalization and Domestic Politics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most robust findings in international and comparative political
 economy is the positive state-level correlation between international trade
 and size of the public sector (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Cameron:1978vb,Rodrik:1998te,Garrett:1995tj,Adsera:2002vt"

\end_inset

).
 Most political scientists theorize this regularity as "embedded liberalism,''
 exemplified in the postwar proliferation of Keynesian social pacts that
 promoted open national markets with state-sponsored social protections
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Ruggie:1982wx"

\end_inset

).
 Although social scientists widely agree that the expansion of international
 trade is welfare-improving in the long run, they also agree that the constructi
on or expansion of markets often induces political backlash from domestic
 groups in the short run.
 This backlash requires policymakers in favor of increasing openness to
 compensate such groups through side payments, typically in the form of
 redistributive social spending, lest the necessary political support for
 increasing openness breaks down.
 Even across much disagreement about which aspects of economic openness
 have the most effect on the various components of welfare spending (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Mares:2004el,Ansell:2008wl,Burgoon:2001dp"

\end_inset

), in which countries the relationship holds (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Rudra:2002ui"

\end_inset

), and even whether the focus on economic openness per se is misspecified
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Kim:2007wu,Oatley:2011hv"

\end_inset

), scholars are generally in agreement about the expectation that liberalization
 of national markets elicits a corresponding political backlash from those
 domestic groups who would bear the adjustment costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the leverage it provides to models of the relationship between globaliza
tion and welfare-state effort, there is surprisingly little evidence for
 the assumption that domestic groups harmed by economic liberalization exert
 sufficient political pressure on national policymakers that policymakers
 provide welfare compensation to appease them.
 Hays, Ehrlich, and Peinhardt 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Hays:2005vo"

\end_inset

 find evidence that government spending helps sustain support for free trade,
 and Walter (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "Walter:2010ky"

\end_inset

) finds consistent evidence in Swiss survey data for multiple points in
 the individual-level causal chain of the compensation thesis.
 This current of research on the individual-level evidence for a compensation
 dynamic does not, however, answer the very different question of whether
 the economic insecurity induced by globalization induces an electorally
 significant threat for liberalizing policymakers.
 Margalit (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "Margalit:2011hm"

\end_inset

) finds that job losses due to offshoring had a stronger negative effect
 on incumbent vote share than job losses not related to offshoring.
 Additionally, that study also finds that spending from the Trade Adjustment
 Assistance program significantly reduced the size of the effect.
 Still, it remains unclear whether and how other institutions moderate the
 public perceptions and electoral consequences of liberalization and if
 different dimensions of liberalization have the same domestic effects as
 offshoring in particular.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Guisinger:2009vt"

\end_inset

 finds that trade policy may not be sufficiently salient, even to the most
 affected groups, to justify voter-driven models of trade policy.
 Baker (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "Baker:2003ci,Baker:2005jg,Baker:2009ta"

\end_inset

) argues that, especially in the developing world, public support for trade
 openness remains high because it is associated with relatively high-quality
 goods at relatively low prices, despite sometimes dramatic negative macro-econo
mic consequences.
 Such findings from Guisinger and Baker highlight pathways through which
 certain negative effects of trade liberalization can have different effects
 on individuals, depending on how they are perceived.
 Baker's finding of high support for free trade even in national contexts
 of dramatic negative macro-economic consequences, only adds scholarly interest
 to the puzzle of precisely
\emph on
 how
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
why
\emph default
 individuals come to find consumption effects more salient than other effects
 of trade liberalization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other research also suggests causal pathways through which citizens harmed
 by the adjustment costs of liberalization would not hold policymakers accountab
le for the political decision of liberalization.
 First, research mostly from advanced democratic countries finds that as
 the sources of economic growth shift, citizens accordingly adjust their
 expectations of government policymaking and their attributions of blame
 for national problems.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Expectations of government policymaking and blame attributions are not only
 driven by material or institutional changes in the political economy but
 may also be endogenous to vote choice or the partisan composition of an
 incumbent government (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Wlezien:1997ia"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Using time-series data from France between 1985 and 2002, Hellwig shows
 that as exposure to trade and capital flows increase, citizens becomes
 less confident in the ability of national policymakers to solve national
 problems and the public demand for economic policy solutions decreases
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hellwig:2007wt"

\end_inset

).
 Voters also adjust their judgement of governments in predictable ways as
 other components of the institutional context change.
 For instance, when the Bank of England gained political independence, British
 voters were less likely to base their evaluation of the government on monetary
 policy and more likely to base it on fiscal policy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key ":2010fv"

\end_inset

).
 Just as evaluations of government shift with the material and institutional
 sources of economic outcomes, so too does blame for national economic problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, perceptions and blame attributions affect political outcomes by
 altering what policymakers can be credibly held accountable for.
 Analyzing all 560 democratic elections between 1975 and 2002, Hellwig and
 Samuels (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "Hellwig:2007gn"

\end_inset

) show that as trade and capital flows increase as a share of gross domestic
 product, domestic economic growth rates have a smaller effect on incumbent
 vote share.
 Cross-sectional analyses of French and British survey data from 1997 and
 2001, respectively, show similar effects of globalization on the determinants
 of vote choice, decreasing the effect of voter's economic performance evaluatio
ns and party positions on economic issues (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hellwig:2008ia"

\end_inset

).
 Perceptual shifts in the ability of governments to affect economic policy
 also affect voter turnout.
 Analysis from the United States has found that individuals who suffer the
 economic adversity but do not blame the government are less likely to vote
 than comparable individuals who do blame the government (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Arcenaux:2003ue"

\end_inset

).
 In terms of policymaking, elite messaging in the mass media (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hellwig:2011iu"

\end_inset

) and interviews with party elites in Europe (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "206"
key "Hellwig:2012vk"

\end_inset

) confirm that politicians consciously stress globalization constraints
 on their own behavior.
 Additionally, changes in the institutional setting are found to have predictabl
e moderating effects on the responsivness of policy to public opinion.
 For instance, Sattler, Brandt, and Freeman (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key ":2010fv"

\end_inset

) show that before central bank independence, British fiscal and monetary
 policies were responsive to aggregate voting intentions and government
 approval ratings but, after central bank indepedence, monetary policy was
 no longer responsive.
 Interestingly, however, Sattler, Brandt, and Freeman 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Sattler:2008vw"

\end_inset

 find mutual responsiveness between public opinion and policy 
\emph on
outputs
\emph default
, despite a lack of responsiveness in policy 
\emph on
outcomes
\emph default
 such as inflation and economic growth.
 That this responsiveness is observed outside real economic outcomes is
 accredited to the difficulty of identifying the effects of policies in
 open economies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that public perceptions of the institutional context have been shown
 to affect political consequences of the economy, it is puzzling that scholarshi
p on the domestic politics of economic globalization has largely neglected
 a serious inquiry into political communication and the mass media in particular.
 Individuals do not 
\emph on

\emph default
 monitor levels of economic openness independent of some political communication
 channel.
 Additionally, policymakers are not passive victims of globalization's encroachm
ent on their room to maneuver.
 Rather, scholars of American politics have shown that national policymakers
 actively engage in strategies of

 through the mass media (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Variation in blame attributions, in turn, has predictable effects on how
 individuals judge both policies and policymakers (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "McGraw:1995up"

).
 Other work has shown that under certain conditions mass media can diffuse
 blame through issue framing (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Iyengar:1987uo"

\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), and exacerbate inequalities in political participation (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Norris:2000uf"

\end_inset

).
 More generally, a formidable and highly critical tradition of observers
 have advanced richly argued but largely untested propositions converging
 on the expectation of profoundly antidemocratic tendencies in the modern
 mass media (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Herman:1988ta,adorno2001culture,mcchesney2000rich"

\end_inset

).
 In light of these research currents, it is a surprising omission in previous
 research on the domestic politics of globalization that testimony by party
 elites in research interviews (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "206-07"
key "Hellwig:2012vk"

\end_inset

) and via the mass media (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

after "420-21"
key "Hellwig:2011iu"

\end_inset

) is more often cited as evidence of room-to-maneuver constraints than questione
d as possible strategic communication or media bias.
 Especially because evidence for opinion-policy responsiveness in open economies
 can be observed apart from and despite the objective economic effects of
 policy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Sattler:2008vw"

\end_inset

, a necessary next step in studying the domestic politics of globalization
 is to theorize more specifically how political communication---in particular,
 the mass media---directly and indirectly affects the relationship between
 objective patterns of economic openness and domestic political outcomes.

Theory and Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A central premise of this article is that issues of economic openness have
 been socially constructed by elite opinion-leaders as an external and objective
 process, typically known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

globalization,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which shapes policymakers' room-to-maneuver (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hay:2002iy,Hay:2005dh,Hay:2011dh"

\end_inset

).
 The novel and central theoretical claim of this article is that the mass
 media diffuse responsibility for policies of economic liberalization over
 and above whatever diffusion of responsibility is created by the objective
 realities of economic openness.
 The warrant for this claim is straightforward: the mass media amplify and
 extend the reach of elite-sponsored social constructions beyond the reach
 they would have in the absence of mass media.
 This section develops the reasoning which moves from this premise to the
 central claim and then deduces a series of hypotheses regarding how mass
 media should be expected to affect individuals' perceptions of economic
 openness, blame attributions for national problems, and ultimately the
 decisions of national policymakers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous research amply demonstrates that the dominant social construction
 of economic globalization is that of an external, objective pressure on
 policymakers---an image of economic globalization which commands a relative
 consensus among elites.
 In addition to the multiple studies by Colin Hay and associates on elite
 discourse from multiple European countries, empirical evidence for an elite
 consensus is also ample from other research on the domestic politics of
 globalization, which finds that party elites consistently invoke

Given this elite consensus regarding the dominant social construction of
 globalization, standard theories of media coverage lead to the expectation
 that the media will tend to amplify this particular social construction.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

indexing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 theory of news coverage suggests that the distribution of news coverage
 on a particular political issue will tend to follow the distribution of
 elite opinion on that issue (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Bennett:1990bp,Zaller:1996vs,Bennett:2006gc"

\end_inset

).
 Given the dominant elite perspective on globalization, namely that it is
 an external and objective process impinging on national policymaking rather
 than a product of national policymaking, an indexing theory of news coverage
 would suggest that mass media is more likely to represent economic globalizatio
n as an external constraint on policymaker autonomy rather than alternative
 critical narratives attributing responsbility to governments for negative
 consequences of globalization.
 Adding to the indexing theory the general responsibility-diffusing tendencies
 inherent to mass media discussed above, such as its episodic nature and
 its tendency to amplify political elites (who are known to actively avoid
 blame), the overall implication is the expectation that mass media will
 amplify the dominant construction of economic globalization as an external
 pressure which imposes itself on domestic policymakers, rather than an
 outcome of policymaking for which policymakers might be held responsible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This basic indexing theory leads to two different versions of a first hypothesis
, one implying a direct effect and the other implying an indirect effect.
 Mass media may have an indirect effect on how individuals attribute blame
 for national problems, by informing individuals of objective problems pertainin
g to economic openness (merely transmitting information about objectively
 constraining realities pertaining to economic openness).
 The stronger version of this argument is that mass media may have a direct
 effect on how individuals attribute blame for national problems, uniquely
 diffusing responsibility in their perception of national problems above
 and beyond its effect of making individuals more aware of the problems
 of economic openness per se.

It stands to reason that various individual-level factors might condition
 this general expectation.
 Political partisanship, political interest and/or knowledge, economic anxiety,
 and various other factors might deserve to be included not only as control
 variables (as they are here, data permitting) but as interaction terms
 capturing the heterogeneity of effects.
 While a great number of additional complicating factors are plausible,
 no general argument linking media to the globalization-welfare nexus has
 yet been established in the literature.
 Therefore I only seek to theorize and test one set of general causal links,
 in order that future research may then investigate various plausible forms
 of causal complexity within the general arguments and evidence presented

Hypothesis 1: Individuals more exposed to mass media are more likely to

Hypothesis 2 captures implications of previous research suggesting that
 perceptions of a policymaker's

 affect how individuals evaluate government performance.
 If the effect of economic perceptions on vote choice weakens because increasing
 economic openness shifts blame attributions toward the global economy and
 away from governments, then blame attributions should be associated with

 and Boix point out in a footnote, if turnout varies across domestic groups
 then the incentives driving the provision of compensation should change.
 Intuitively, the incentives for pro-trade party 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 to offer a compensation package decrease as the voter turnout of either
 
\emph on
C
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
P
\emph default
 decreases, because the opposition of these groups only matters for the
 policy outcome if that opposition has electoral salience for them; 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 is required to provide compensation to 
\emph on
P
\emph default
 only to the degree that 
\emph on
C
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
P
\emph default
 would vote against 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 because of its position on trade policy.
 If mass media increases the 
\emph on
perception 
\emph default
that economic liberalization is a process occurring external to domestic
 policymakers and is therefore domestically blameless, the effect would
 be to reduce the electoral salience of liberalization for those otherwise
 opposed to it.
 This is functionally equivalent to reducing the voter turnout of 
\emph on
C
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
P
\emph default
 around trade policy.
 Insofar as mass media tend to diffuse blame attributions for the negative
 effects of economic liberalization, this decreases the incentives for harmed
 groups to oppose liberalization by voting, and thus should have an effect
 equivalent to decreasing their turnout in this electoral game.
 Therefore the provision of compensatory public spending in response to
 economic openness should be conditional on levels of mass media.
 The final hypothesis encapsulates this implication.

 Respondents are asked to identify their main source of information from

 Respondents are also asked to identify the top two problems facing France,
 and whether individuals, social institutions, the government, or international
 forces beyond government control are to blame for the problem.

 Finally, respondents are asked about their satisfaction with President
 Mitterrand, how well they think the government is handling the problem
 identified by the respondent as a top problem, and their intention to turnout
 for the March 1993 elections.
 There are several reasons why French survey data from the early 1990s represent
s a uniquely useful laboratory for testing the individual-level hypotheses.
 First, while other surveys gauge perceptions of responsibility on many
 issues, and many other surveys gauge media exposure, this is the only survey
 known to the author which effectively gauges both perceptions of responsbility
 for issues of economic openness and media exposure.
 Second, although the survey data is limited to France and therefore limits
 our ability to generalize to other countries, France is a hard case for
 testing the hypotheses, and so evidence for the hypotheses would suggest
 such a process is likely to occur in other countries as well.
 First, the survey takes place around the time of the Maastricht Treaty,
 a time when the problems of economic openness are highly policy-related.
 If media diffuses blame away from governments and onto international forces
 in France in the early 1990s, mass media is even more likely to do the
 same in situations where problems of economic openness are less related
 to high-visibility policy decisions.
 Additionally, France has relatively high rates of political engagement,
 and a statist, egalitarian political culture in which elite opinion claims
 more control over globalization than in countries such as Italy or the
 United Kingdom (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "159"
key "Hay:2011dh"

\end_inset

).
 Thus, evidence that mass media leads French citizens near the time of the
 Maastricht Treaty to blame international forces rather than their government
 suggests that such a relationship is even more likely in countries where
 globalization is more widely seen as ineluctable.
 Although ideally the hypotheses could be tested in multiple countries at
 once, this particular survey offers an ideal opportunity to test the hypotheses
 under conditions relatively favorable to generalization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test the direct and indirect effects of mass media on blame (Hypothesis
 1), I estimate two logistic regression models.
 The first estimates the probability a respondent will blame international
 forces as a function of mass media exposure and a vector of control variables

 The equation is

Because of space constraints and for ease of interpretation in light of

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 However, the results obtained here are robust to alternative specifications
 in which the dependent variable takes a value of 1 for respondents who
 blame international forces and 0 for respondents who select any of the
 other possible targets of blame.
 See Supplementary Information.
\end_layout

 is a categorical variable with four levels indicating whether the problem
 deals with social, economic, political, or foreign issues;

 as the top problem facing France that a question was added to measure what

 All the analyses here, including the variables measuring blame attributions
 and evaluations of government handling, refer to this second most important
 problem.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $Openness\: Problem$
\end_inset

 is a binary variable I constructed to take a value of 1 for respondents
 who identified a problem specifically related to economic openness and
 0 otherwise.
 If the mass media have an independent effect on diffusing blame away from
 government policymakers and toward international forces, then we would
 expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{3}$
\end_inset

 to be positive and significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, to assess the indirect effect of mass media on blame as its channeled
 through perceptions of economic openness, I estimate a logistic regression
 modeling the probability of perceiving openness as a top problem as a function
 of mass media exposure and a vector of control variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the main variables of interest are the same as in Equation 1 except
 that here the dependent variable is the binary variable capturing whether
 openness is perceived as a top problem.
 If mass media affect blame attributions indirectly by making individuals
 more aware of international economic forces, which in turn would shift
 their blame toward international forces, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}$
\end_inset

 should be positive and significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test Hypothesis 2 regarding the effect of blame attributions on evaluations
 of the government, I estimate a linear regression modeling how individuals
 evaluate the government's handling of the problem they identified as one
 of the most important facing the country.
 I model evaluations of government handling as a function of respondents'
 blame attributions and a vector of control variables.
 The equation is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 The theory predicts that for a particular problem such as the domestic
 costs of economic openness, blaming international forces rather than the
 government will make individuals less likely to hold governments accountable
 for that problem.
 If this is the case, then individuals who think a problem is caused by
 forces outside of the government's purview should be less critical of the
 government's handling of that problem.
 In this case, then, the theoretical expectation is that 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{3}$

 forces for a problem leads individuals to view the government's handling
 of that problem more favorably than if they blamed the government for the

 Because the theory deals with the conditioning effects of mass media on
 domestic exposure to the global economy, I am most interested in the multiplica
tive interaction of trade and mass media (
\begin_inset Formula $Trade_{it-1}*MDI_{it-1}$
\end_inset

) rather than the independent marginal effects.
 If mass media exposure has the individual-level effects hypothesized above,
 then an increasing density of mass media technologies within a state should
 weaken the positive relationship historically observed between levels of
 trade openness and levels of domestic spending.
 In other words, the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{3}$
\end_inset

 should be negative and significant, reflecting that the predicted effect
 of trade on spending given high levels of mass media is less than the predicted
 effect that trade has on spending given low levels of mass media.
 In the first models testing Hypothesis 3, a battery of controls are included
 to account for non-trade and non-media determinants of government consumption
 expenditure.
 Data for testing particular rival explanations are more limited and therefore
 reduce the geographic and temporal coverage of the main economic and media
 data.
 For this reason, I check the robustness of my models against alternative
 explanations in a set of subsequent models.

 Respondents who rely on the mass media as their most important source of
 information are significantly more likely to blame international forces
 for what they identify as one of the nation's top problems (a logit estimate
 of .35 and standard error of .12), even controlling for perceptions of economic
 openness as a problem and the more general issue area in which a respondent
 locates that problem.
 To get a better sense of the effect size, consider probabilities.
 Based on 1000 simulations, the probability of blaming international forces
 for a typical individual who does not rely primarily on the mass media
 for information is .33.
 Relying primarily on mass media increases this probability to .41 (a mean
 change of .08 with a standard deviation of .03).

It could be the case that individuals with cosmopolitan outlooks are more
 interested in mass media 
\emph on
because
\emph default
 of their greater interest in global issues, in which case mass media exposure
 could be endogenous to knowledge of issues surrounding economic globalization.
 Although the survey data used in this paper provide no measure of overall
 interest in international affairs, the analyses below control for the best
 predictors of cosmpolitanism: education, class, and general interest in
 politics.
 Because these are the best predictors of cosmpolitanism, it is unlikely
 that a partial, independent effect of mass media exposure would be spurious
 due to this particular risk of endogeneity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Indeed, of all the variables considered here, the perception of economic
 openness as one of the nation's top problems is the strongest determinant
 of whether a respondent will blame international forces for that problem
 (a logit estimate of 1.1 and standard error of .14).
 In this case, for a typical individual who identifies a top problem other
 than one of openness the probability of blaming international forces is
 .41 but for the same individual who identifies a top problem related to
 openness, that probability increases to .68 (a mean increase of .26 and standard
 deviation .03).
 To check the robustness of this finding, I also estimate several models
 using different operationalizations of the dependent variable.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Whereas Model 1 considers for simplicity the binary opposition between blaming
 the government (dependent variable equal to 0) and blaming international
 forces (dependent variable equal to 1), I estimated additional models where
 the binary dependent variable opposes each of these targets of blame to
 anyone who blames any other target.
 See Supplementary Information.

Model 2 considers the indirect effect of mass media on blame attributions
 through their effect on perceptions of openness as a problem.
 Reliance on mass media has a positive marginal effect on the perception
 of openness as a problem (a logit estimate of .33 and standard error of
 .17; 
\emph on
p
\emph default
=.06).
 For a typical individual who does not rely primarily on mass media, the
 probability of perceiving an issue of openness to be a top problem is .08;
 relying on mass media increases this probability by a mean of .03 (standard
 deviation = .01) to .11.
 Thus, the indirect effect of mass media on blaming international forces,
 through its slight marginal effect on the perception of openness as a problem,
 is merely .01 (.26*.03).
 The small size of this effect and its statistical significance near the
 conventional cutoff of 95% confidence suggest only weak evidence that mass
 media exerts much indirect effect on blame attributions by increasing awareness
 of openness as a problem.

There is reason to suppose that blame attributions could be endogenous to
 evaluations of how the government is handling a problem, in the sense that
 perceptions of poor or satisfactory government handling could increase
 or decrease the government's perceived culpability.
 First, however, it should be recalled that survey question I am using to
 measure blame attributions refers specifically to the cause of the problem.
 Thus, strictly speaking, evaluations of how the government handles the
 problem should not affect who or what individuals identify as the cause
 or source of the problem.
 Second, it is much harder to believe that evaluations of government handling
 could drive individuals' blame of international forces or blame of the
 two alternative targets from which respondents were able to choose (individuals
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

like you and I
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or social institutions) simply because it is hard to imagine how government
 handling of the problem could make any of these other targets more or less
 culpable.
 Thus, I estimate an additional model which has separate binary independent
 variables for blaming government, international forces, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the baseline (see Supplementary Information).
 The coefficient for blaming government is larger than that for blaming
 international forces but both remain signed as expected and significant.
 This alternative specification mitigates the possibility that blaming internati
onal forces merey reflects respondents who are less likely to blame the
 government.
 Finally, if it can be assumed that endogeneity between evaluations of handling
 and blame would be most likely among partisans, then the control for partisansh
ip and the two separate controls for support of President Mitterrand likely
 absorb much of this endogeneity.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Simulating quantities of interest suggests that blaming international forces
 for a top problem increases a typical individual's evaluation of government
 handling by .38 (standard devation = .03), from 1.6 to 2.0 on the four-point
 scale of the dependent variable.
 These results also hold when the dependent variable refers to satisfaction
 with the President rather than government handling of a top problem.
 They are also robust to an expanded operationalization of the blame variable
 considering the government, international forces, and other possible targets.

Thus the results provide evidence consistent with each essential step of
 the causal chain at the individual level, though the estimated indirect
 effect of mass media on diffusing blame (through increasing perceptions
 of openness as a problem) is very weak.
 Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that mass media directly diffuse blame
 away from governments toward international forces (increasing the probability
 of blaming international forces by about 8%) even controlling for the general
 issue area in which the respondent locates a top problem and whether it
 is related to openness.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 1 displays results from three regression models which provide initial
 support for the state-level expectations regarding the effect of mass media
 on the globalization-welfare relationship.
 Models 4 and 5 consider variable levels only, while Model 6 is an error-correct
ion model using first-differences (year-to-year changes) in the dependent
 variable and lagged levels of the dependent variable on the right-hand
 side of the equation, alongside levels and first-differences of the key
 independent variables.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For Model 6, inclusion of a second lag of level of spending (
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

) makes the covaration matrix non-invertible and therefore precludes a unique
 estimation of the model.
 However, omitting it leads us to reject the null hypothesis of no serial
 correlation in the error term according to the Breusch-Godfrey test for
 panel models (p=0.026).

 the null hypothesis of no serial correlation (p=.13).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Although a level dependent variable with a lagged level on the right-hand
 side is formally equivalent to a differenced dependent variable, the error-corr
ection specification is useful here because it allows us to separate short-run
 and long-run effects.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The error-correction specification is useful here for another reason.
 Although government spending and media density are not quite co-integrated,
 they are nearly cointegrated as both trend upward over time.
 In such situations, error-correction specifications are ideal for insuring
 against the possibility of spurious correlations driven by that shared
 integration.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The differenced independent variables reflect immediate, short-run effects
 and the level independent variables reflect the long-run effect after the
 short-run effects decay.
 All three models include fixed effects for country and year to account
 for unobserved differences in countries or unobserved temporal shocks in
 any particular year.

 in Model 4 suggests that, on average, a two standard deviation increase
 in media density (109.3 points) in the long-run decreases the estimated
 effect that a two standard deviation increase in trade openness (85.2% of
 GDP) would have on government spending by .97% of GDP.
 Model 6 estimates that this negative conditioning effect of media density
 is as little as .61% of GDP.
 Moving from the minimum density of media (0) to the maximum in the sample
 (313.3) is associated, on average, with a decrease of as much as 2.78%, and
 as little as 1.8%, in the expected effect of an 85% increase in trade openness
 on government spending as a share of GDP.
 Although the estimated effect appears relatively slight, it should be kept
 in mind that the mean level of government consumption expenditure in the
 sample is only 15.7% of GDP.
 Thus, for a country that begins with no mass media and becomes as fully
 penetrated as the most penetrated (the United States in 1986), the roughly
 1-3% of GDP by which we would expect the country to reduce its compensatory
 public spending in the long-run for an 85% increase in trade openness is
 a substantial portion of what a typical country spends.

Models 5 and 6 also tests the conditioning effect of media density against
 the conditioning effects of democracy on the trade-welfare relationship,
 which previous research has found to increase the redistributive responsiveness
 of domestic welfare spending to international trade (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Adsera:2002vt"

 The results here suggest that media density has a robust conditioning effect
 on the relationship between trade and spending, while the interaction found
 by Adserà and Boix no longer appears statistically distinguishable from
 zero.

To check for the possibility that the above models are spuriously driven
 by some different but unobserved process distinct from the effects of mass
 media, I gather additional data to test my state-level argument against
 a series of rival explanations.
 Specifically, it is argued that left parties and union density are aspects
 of the domestic institutional environment which lead to more redistributive
 responses to economic liberalization (

); that electoral systems defined by proportional representation are more
 redistributive than majoritarian systems (

); and that the degree of unitarism or government centralization affects
 welfare spending (

 Finally, of particular interest in the literature relating economic globalizati

 The coefficients and standard errors are not substantially changed (see

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study has presented individual- and state-level evidence that mass
 media functions as a political institution which conditions the domestic
 politics of economic globalization.
 Because the dominant social construction of economic globalization is that
 of an external constraint imposed on policymakers by impersonal and internation
al forces, by amplifying this construction mass media decrease the accountabilit
y of national economic policymakers who pursue liberalization.
 Survey evidence from France shows that individuals most reliant on mass
 media are less likely to blame top national problems on incumbent governments,
 and more likely to blame international forces, for indirect and direct
 reasons.
 Mass media 
\emph on
indirectly
\emph default
 deflects blame away from incumbent governments and toward international
 forces by making individuals more aware of economic openness as a political
 issue, but it also 
\emph on
directly
\emph default
 decreases individuals' propensities to blame incumbents relative to internation
al forces (controlling for the awareness effect), most likely due to the
 responsbility-diffusing framing effects previously found in mass media
 studies.
 In turn, individuals who blame international forces rather than the government
 evaluate the government more favorably.
 Cross-sectional, time-series data reveal that mass media is associated
 with a decrease in the relationship between economic openness and welfare-state
 spending, providing further evidence that mass media diffuses the domestic
 political pressure against liberalization that has historically elicited
 welfare-state compensation for aggrieved domestic groups.
 The state-level evidence is consistent with the individual-level evidence
 that mass media shifts blame attributions away from governments and toward
 international forces, which weakens the strategic pressure on national
 economic policymakers to provide welfare-state compensation to harmed domestic
 groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitations of this study also point to avenues for future research
 on the attitudinal and behavioral mechanisms shaping the domestic politics
 of economic globalization.
 While I considered many dominant rival hypotheses through the use of statistica
l control variables and the inclusion of alternative interaction terms,
 this article could not engage with all possible factors that may plausibly
 condition the relationships posited by the three hypotheses presented.
 Thus, future research must investigate the sensitivity and conditionality
 of the general findings presented here.
 For instance, it seems likely that political partisanship might condition
 the relationship between media exposure and blame attributions, and/or
 the relationship between blame attributions and evaluations of government.
 Thus, rather than simply controlling for partisanship as above, future
 research might investigate whether these relationships are dampened or
 amplified under different conditions of citizen and government partisanship.
 Additionally, for the state-level findings, future research might investigate
 whether the conditioning effect of media on the globalization-welfare nexus
 is not itself conditional on region, national government partisanship,
 or various factors related to the national media environment (such as media
 concentration, ownership, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The findings have several implications for the study of international and
 comparative politics and for the prospects of democracy in a globalized
 world.
 First, the results provide some of the first evidence that mass media can
 be understood as a political institution that conditions the domestic politics
 of the global economy, thus placing on the agenda a source of cross-national
 and temporal variation typically omitted from previous analyses of comparative
 and international political economy.
 As such, they contribute to current research agendas seeking more finely-tuned
 political accounts of the domestic effects of globalization (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
after "341"
key "Kayser:2007iga"

\end_inset

) and a better understanding of public opinion and voting behavior in the
 context of economic openness (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hellwig:2008ia,Hellwig:2008cj"

\end_inset

).
 Specifically, the article suggests that mass media is an independent cause
 of voters discounting their evaluations of policymakers (by increasing
 the probability they will identify economic openness as a top problem,
 but also by directly diffusing blame attributions toward international
 forces 
\emph on
even holding constant the types of problems they perceive to be most important
\emph default
).
 The findings should be of particular interest to scholars seeking to develop
 more rigorous micro-foundations for the relationship between economic openness
 and welfare states (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Hays:2005vo,Walter:2010ky"

\end_inset

).
 Second, the state-level findings in particular have an important substantive
 implication, for they suggest that the omission of mass media in previous
 studies may have led to biased conclusions which over-estimate the egalitarian
 responsiveness of welfare states in the globalization-welfare nexus.
 The evidence suggests that from the standpoint of democratic values, mass
 media can have subtle but perverse effects on the distributive politics
 of open economies, disempowering domestic groups from holding national
 policymakers accountable for the unevenly distributed costs of globalization.

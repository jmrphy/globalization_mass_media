### From reviews

better specify what exactly the role of the media is

better explain exactly why media push blame toward international forces away from government
	- is it the protectionist individuals are different somehow?

better explain why France is a good case
	- address whether France might just be exceptionally concerned with problems of anti-globalization?

clear up how indexing --> blame international.
	- indexing also involves widening or closing based on elite widening or closing

- include more on issue framing in news articles and anecdotal examples from print or TV

- address conventional expectation which is that the media over-blames government actors!
	- also because of the large body of work by besley et all about how media does enforce accountability

- get rid of individual-level figures
	- also because they're not continuous

- description of variables could be clearer

- make more clear which data is being analyzed in individual level models

- make more clear model in figure 4 estimated?

- relabel blame variable to be more intuitive

- recode international openness indicator to exclude EC-related stuff and try that

- reorganize results to do introduce/perform on French data first, then state-level second

- where are model estimates related to equation 5?

- use better labels in state-level model results

- engage stefanie walter (ISQ)

- in rival explanations models i should really run interactions with the rivals

- fix typos in formal model

### Theory should be restated as follows.

2 arguments.

1: The mass media diffuse blame for globalisation.
There are two simple reasons for this.
	- 1. Globalisation has been constructed as objective process (All Hay's pieces)
	- 2. Media diffuses responsibility by episodic framings (Iyengar 1991)
Therefore, the more exposed to mass media one is, the more likely they are to blame international forces and not the government
  
2. Diffusion of blame is equivalent to demobilisation of the aggrieved. Can be modeled as a decrease in turnout from the aggrieved group or a decrease in issue salience.

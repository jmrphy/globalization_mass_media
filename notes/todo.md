### Theory should be restated as follows.

2 arguments.

1: The media diffuses blame for globalisation.
  Premise: Globalisation is presented as an objective process (All Hay's pieces)
  Premise: Media diffuses responsibility
  Premise: Politicians actively avoid blame whenever possible.
  Premis: Reporters index reportage to politicians.
  Conclusion: Media reportage will amplify responsibility-diffusing.
  
2. Diffusion of blame is equivalent to demobilisation of the aggrieved. Can be modeled as a decrease in turnout from the aggrieved group or a decrease in issue salience.

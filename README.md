This repository contains the data and code required to reproduce my dissertation article entitled "Mass Media and the Domestic Politics of Economic Globalization." However it excludes Arthur Banks' Cross-National Time-Series dataset because it's proprietary and he strikes me as the type of guy who would actually sue. If one wishes to reproduce the state-level analyses, one will have to obtain this dataset from a library. The individual-level survey data, however, is in the public domain and included in the /data directory.

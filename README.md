This repository contains the data and code required to reproduce my dissertation article entitled "Mass Media and the Domestic Politics of Economic Globalization." Being only my first effort toward "reproducible research," this repository will certainly fall short of the highest standards in this emerging practice, sorry. Finally, and significantly, it excludes Arthur Banks' Cross-National Time-Series dataset because it's proprietary and he strikes me as the kind of guy who would actually sue me. If one wishes to reproduce the state-level analyses, one will have to obtain this dataset from a library. The individual-level survey data, however, is in the public domain and included in the /data directory.
